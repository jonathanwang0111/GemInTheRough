# GemInTheRough

Gem in the Rough is essentially a highlight of some of the code I wrote previously for an unfinished game. It is a Unity Engine based game where the goal is to get to the destination (a Gem). There are cherries along the way that act as checkpoints. An eagle is looking for you and will chase you down via a pathfinding system.
